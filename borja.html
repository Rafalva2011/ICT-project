  <p>About us:</p>
  <p>I am a 13-year-old Mexican. I was born on August 31, 2011. I have an 11-year-old brother whose name is Tadeo. My brother and I go to Churchill School. I am in the 1st grade of secondary school, and Tadeo is in the 4th grade.</p>

  <p> Hobbies and Likes:</p>
  <p> I play a lot of football—I really like it, and I spend almost every day after school playing. I support Real Madrid from Spain and Toluca FC from Mexico. Besides football, I also like playing paddle and tennis at my club. I go swimming every weekend and sometimes run with my dad. I enjoy music too, and I always listen to it when doing homework. My favorite genre is rap, but I like a bit of everything.</p>

  <p>Trips:</p>
  <p>I’ve traveled to many places. In Mexico, I’ve been to Pachuca, Toluca, San Luis Potosí, Pátzcuaro, Michoacán, Morelia, Monterrey, Cozumel, Ixtapa, Valle de Bravo, and Oaxaca City. My favorite places were Monterrey because of the good food and nice people, and Zihuatanejo because of the amazing seafood and views. I love warm weather and nice scenery.</p>
  <p> Outside of Mexico, I’ve traveled to Europe and the USA. In the USA, I’ve been to San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Marcos, Houston, Austin, Nuevo Laredo, and San Antonio. My favorite places were San Francisco, because of the views and friendly people, and Los Angeles, just because I liked it a lot.</p>

  <p>Achievements: </p>
  <p>I haven’t had any big achievements yet, but I’m proud of playing in my first regional tournament. I had a great time and the competition was good. I’ve also improved my grades a lot at school. I know I’m not the best student, but if I set a goal and work hard, I can achieve it.</p>

  <p>Goals:</p>
  <p> One of my main long-term goals is to get a football scholarship at a high school in Texas. I want to study while doing what I love. If I can, I’d like to play at the college level and maybe even try for the MLS draft, though that’s a big dream.</p>
  <p> I also want to get better at school and raise my average to a 9. This will help me get a good scholarship and open more opportunities.</p>
