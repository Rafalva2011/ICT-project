    <h1>Hello, welcome to our website!</h1>
    <p> Welcome to our website! We are: Rafael, Camila, Maite, Galo, and Borja; the fundator of this website. We started this project with the purpose of sharing specific aspects of our personal lives that we want to share with our readers. Each of the five main areas that make up this website offers a special window into a different facet of our lives:</p>

    <p> About Us: We each introduce ourselves in this section. You'll discover our histories, personalities, how we connected or became friends, and what makes each of us special. It allows you to learn more about us than just our names.</p>

    <p> Hobbies and Likes: We discuss our favorite things here, including music, sports, movies, art, food, and anything else that brings us joy. These minor nuances serve to highlight the things that motivate and inspire us in day-to-day living.</p>
    <p> Trips: This section focuses on the locations we have visited. We talk about our trip experiences, favorite spots, enjoyable times, and perhaps even some difficulties we had. Our travels, whether local or distant, have influenced who we are.</p>
    <p> Achievements: Everyone has something they're proud of, and here we share a few of ours, whether they be academic achievements, personal objectives met, artistic endeavors finished, or times when we overcome challenges. The goal is to celebrate progress rather than perfection.</p>
    <p> Goals: Lastly, we turn to the future. Each of us discusses some of our future objectives in this part, including things we hope to discover, accomplish, develop, or become. It's a place for aspiration, hope, and personal development.</p>
