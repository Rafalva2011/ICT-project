  <h1>Rafael</h1>
  <h3>About Us:</h3>
  <p>My name is Rafael Alva González. I am a Mexican boy that borned on May 6, 2011. I live in a sweet 3-level-house with my two parents. I have 2 little fish in a fish tank; one is grey and the other one is white. My favorite color is blue. Nowadays, I am in the Churchill School in highschool. I am a hardwork person, with a positive personality focusing on achieving many goals in life. </p>
  <h3>Hobbies and Likes:</h3
  <p> I like to play the piano. For nine years (since I was four years old), I have been playing the piano; I like to hear classical and POP music. Normally, I have three-to-four piano lessons a week.Also, I like to play Ping Pong with my dad, since I started practicing at a very young age. Football is my favorite sport; I like watching football (especially Mexican football) and playing with my friends and family, but I consider myself that I am very bad at playing this sport</p>

  <h3>Trips: </h3>
  <p>I have traveled extensively to different countries and parts of Mexico. While abroad, I've been to Denmark and Sydney (one of my favorite trips). More recently, I've been to Vancouver and New York. In Mexico, I've also visited several parts and states, including Guadalajara (Jalisco), Michoacán, Morelos, Pachuca, Baja California Sur, and Quintana Roo.</p>

  <h3>Achievements:</h3>
  <p>My recent achievements include: making great progress on the piano, making more friends, and developing my social and balance skills. I've demonstrated this by setting examples for others to see how well I do things.</p>

  <h3>Goals: </h3>
  <p>My goals are: to continue succeeding in life, to make more friends and colleagues with whom we have a very good relationship, and to reach a point where I can become a musician in the future.</p>
