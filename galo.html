  <h1>Galo</h1>
  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Galo. I am 13 year old who was born on October 13, 2011. Iam from Mexico and proud of my heritage. I go to Churchill School, where I discover new stuff and make great friends. Since I'm an only child, I've learned to be independent and come up with fun ways to keep myself busy.</p>

  <h3>Hobbies and Likes:</h3>
  <p>I really like football, and my favorite team is FC Barcelona. I like watching the games, especially when my favorite player, Raphinha, is playing and showing  his skills. Besides football, I am into parkour, where I try new jumps and flips. Karate is also a big part of my life because it teaches me discipline, strength, and focus. Also, I like playing video games. Sushi is my favorite food, and I always enjoy trying new kinds whenever I get the chance.</p>

  <h3>Trips:</h3>
  <p>I have been able to experience several cultures and environments by traveling. I have had the traveling to some places like Barcelona, Bilbao, and San Sebasti√°n. I also whent Japan, where I explored vibrant cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Hiroshima, learning new things. I traveled to Berlin and Paris in Europe, where I learned about their fascinating histories, architecture, and cultures. These travels have broadened my perspectives and given me enduring memories.</p>

  <h3>Achievements and Goals:</h3>
  <p>Getting my brown belt in karate was good. It took a ton of dedication. It really shows that hard work pays off. This keeps me motivated to keep pushing myself. I have some big dreams, like parkour competition to show that practice and determination can really lead to success. Plus, I hope to compete in a karate world cup one day, showcasing my passion and effort on a global level.</p>
