  <h1>Camila</h1>
  <p>About me:</p>
  <p>My name is Camila Feregrino Villarreal, and I was born on February 26, 2011, so I'm 14 years old. I live with my parents, Tayra Villarreal and Manuel Feregrino. I also have a dog named Piki. I love her very much and always play with her. I like spending time with my family and friends. I'm a bit distracted, but I try hard.</p>

  <p> Hobbies:</p>
  <p> In my free time, I like to do a lot of things. I play the piano because it relaxes me. I also play tennis; it's a sport I really enjoy. I play soccer a lot, but I've never taken a class. I feel like I'm not that bad at never having taken one. On weekends, I like to play video games. I have a great time playing alone or with my friends.</p>

  <p>Achievements: </p>
  <ul> Play football decently</ul>
  <ul>Be good in tennis</ul>
  <ul>Do better in math exams this unit</ul>
