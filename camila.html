  <h1>Camila</h1>
  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Camila Feregrino Villarreal, and I was born on February 26, 2011, so I'm 14 years old. I live with my parents, Tayra Villarreal and Manuel Feregrino. I also have a dog named Piki. I love her very much and always play with her. I like spending time with my family and friends. I'm a bit distracted, but I try hard.</p>

  <h3> Hobbies and Likes:</h3>
  <p> In my free time, I like to do a lot of things. I play the piano because it relaxes me. I also play tennis; it's a sport I really enjoy. I play soccer a lot, but I've never taken a class. I feel like I'm not that bad at never having taken one. On weekends, I like to play video games. I have a great time playing alone or with my friends.</p>

  <h3>Trips: </h3>
  <p> Traveling around Mexico has been an awesome adventure. I've seen different areas, learning about the country's cool  culture, stunning scenery, and lively traditions. Every journey teaches me something new and helps me value the variety of my home. I always return with great memories and fun stories to tell.</p>

  <h3>Achievements: </h3>
  <p> I've always played soccer with my friends, but even though I've never taken a class, I feel like I'm not that bad. Tennis is a sport I've continued to play, with classes, from 2018 to today, 2025. I've definitely improved and feel more confident in my game. One of my greatest achievements in this unit was getting better grades on the math tests. I studied harder than usual, and it was really worth it. I like to see progress, both in sports and in academics.</p>

  <h3> Goles:</h3>
  <p>I've always loved playing sports, especially football, where I do pretty well and have scored some awesome goals. I also enjoy tennis and like to play both sports whenever I can. </p>
